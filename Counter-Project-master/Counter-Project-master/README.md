# Counter-Project
A small JavaScript project that wires two buttons to count up or count down.



## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 


## Where to find everything
You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide , which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
